# My Portofolio
Mas Alfin's Portofolio as Programmer

I was born in April 27th 2000
My Hobbies is Learning a New Thing with a Focused Terminology..
Learning about Web 2.0 to know next generation of Web 3.0..

# My Journey
My First Programming Language that I learn is JavaScript..
I learned it when I was 19 Years Old..
It's because I want to know how the Bitcoin Works..
But unfortunately my brains won't take that as a good Term, so I decided to learn The Web 2.0 before I learn The Web 3.0..

My first Learn is about Front End (HTML, CSS, and JavaScirpt) at year 2020..
Then I learn the simplest way to got Front End Layout, so it can be much faster to create the Front End..
- Bootstrap
- AdminLte
- Free Themes based on Bootstrap
I just learn the "dist", "vendor" folder to know how the Front End Structure created and I learn continuously since then..

My second Learn is about Back End (PHP {Blade}, Java, and C#) at year 2021..
When I learn that, I try to search the fastest way to understand how the Back End is working and how the structure of The Back End creadted..
- Blade

I'll try to write more about My Journey until I can learn about Web 3.0..
