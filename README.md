### My Portofolio
Mas Alfin's Portofolio as Programmer

I was born in April 27th 2000 <br/>
My Hobbies is Learning a New Thing with a Focused Terminology.. <br/>
Learning about Web 2.0 to know next generation of Web 3.0.. <br/>

## My Journey
My First Programming Language that I learn is JavaScript.. <br/>
I learned it when I was 19 Years Old.. <br/>
It's because I want to know how the Bitcoin Works.. <br/>
But unfortunately my brains won't take that as a good Term, so I decided to learn The Web 2.0 before I learn The Web 3.0.. <br/>

My first Learn is about Front End (HTML, CSS, and JavaScirpt) at year 2020.. <br/>
Then I learn the simplest way to got Front End Layout, so it can be much faster to create the Front End.. <br/>
- Bootstrap
- AdminLte
- Free Themes based on Bootstrap <br/>

I just learn the "dist", "vendor" folder to know how the Front End Structure created and I learn continuously since then.. <br/>

My second Learn is about Back End (PHP {Blade}, Java, and C#) at year 2021.. <br/>
When I learn that, I try to search the fastest way to understand how the Back End is working and how the structure of The Back End created.. <br/>
- Blade

I'll try to write more about My Journey until I can learn about Web 3.0..

## Learning Current Project

I'm learning the Current Project using Blade Files..
